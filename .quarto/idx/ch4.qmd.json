{"title":"Adding New Indicators","markdown":{"headingText":"Adding New Indicators","containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThe evaluation of new indicators for inclusion in the World Development Indicators (WDI) is governed by similar criteria to those used for existing indicators. Figure 1 illustrates the decision-making pathway for considering new indicators. Nominations for the WDI typically originate from the demands of World Bank staff or partner organizations. Additionally, the WDI team proactively nominates indicators to meet specific user requirements, ensuring that the suite of indicators stays comprehensive and aligned with the dynamic needs of development data users.\n\nThe initiation of an indicator's inclusion in the World Development Indicators (WDI) involves an extensive compilation of its background information. Since the WDI is freely accessible, it is essential to source data from providers that allow its redistribution and open use. The first step is to verify that the data meets the open data standards of the WDI. The presence of comprehensive metadata is a non-negotiable aspect of the process, as it underpins the indicator's credibility and practicality. For example, without a well-defined methodology or unit of measurement, it would be challenging for users to ascertain the indicator's relevance to their research or policy needs. The World Bank's metadata schema specifies a series of mandatory fields that must be completed before an indicator can be published, which are detailed in annex Table A2. If an indicator is nominated without the necessary license information or key metadata, the nomination is paused until these details are provided.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center;color: #6D7A86; font-size: 0.9em\">\nFigure 4.1 WDI Criteria Decision Making Process\n</div>\n\n![](images/fig1.png){fig-align=\"center\"}\n\nThe process of evaluating new data for inclusion in the World Development Indicators (WDI) begins with an assessment of its developmental relevance. This step determines if the data complements the existing indicators or addresses a gap in an emerging or underrepresented development area. It also involves evaluating the data's alignment with the World Bank's strategic goals, sector-specific priorities, or more recently, with the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Subsequently, the indicator's geographic and temporal coverage is examined, often benchmarked against existing WDI indicators as shown in Table 3. The final evaluation stage is the quality assessment of the indicator, which includes consulting with subject matter experts to verify its methodological rigor. Indicators released by authoritative organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, or other UN agencies are presumed to have robust quality control processes in place.\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":""},"formats":{"html":{"identifier":{"display-name":"HTML","target-format":"html","base-format":"html"},"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":false,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"ipynb-shell-interactivity":null,"plotly-connected":true,"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-typ":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"inline-includes":false,"preserve-yaml":false,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-min-runs":1,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[],"notebook-links":true},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["custom.css"],"toc":true,"toc-depth":3,"number-sections":true,"output-file":"ch4.html"},"language":{"toc-title-document":"Table

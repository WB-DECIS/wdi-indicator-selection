Note: This figure is inspired by, and takes some information from, Jolliffe et al. (2023) & Marker (2017). The UN framework has many other attributes most of which are related to managing the statistical system and hence do not relate to the framework of this paper: Coordinating the national statistical system, managing relationships, managing statistical standards, professional independence, adequacy of resources, commitment to quality, appropriate statistical procedures, managing the respondent burden, and cost-effectiveness.

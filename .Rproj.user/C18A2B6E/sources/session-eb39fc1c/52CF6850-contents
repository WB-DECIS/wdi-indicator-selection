# Conclusion

The World Development Indicators (WDI) is an essential resource for researchers, policymakers, and development professionals around the world. To ensure its continued relevance and ease of access, the WDI employs a stringent evaluation framework for potential indicators, focusing on four pivotal criteria: ease of use, trustworthiness, adequate coverage, and high quality. This document has outlined the framework for assessing the suitability of indicators, detailed both quantitative and qualitative evaluation criteria, and discussed examples of potential new indicators as well as those under consideration for discontinuation. By strictly adhering to these evaluative processes, the WDI ensures it remains a trusted source of robust data, crucial for shaping effective development policies and promoting global progress.
